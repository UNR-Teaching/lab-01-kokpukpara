What do you think the > in the previous statement did when combined with the ls command?
* I believe it printed the directory contents into the newfile.txt file.

What does it say about newfile.txt?
* It says it is now in the repository.

What does this command tell you about your files and their contents?
* It notified me that there have been changes to the file since I last added it to the GitHub repository.
